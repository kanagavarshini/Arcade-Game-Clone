### Description of Project
-------------------------------------------------------------
As being a participant of the Grow With Google (GWG) Scholarship program we had to re-create a classic arcade game know to many of us as Frogger. The goal of this project was to help cement the foundations of Object Oriented Programming and what it takes to build a mini game.

### Purpose of Project
--------------------------------------------------------------
GWG participants were challenged to use their new JavaScript skills which they learned. The project was designed to help us better understand the concepts of Object Oriented Programming.

### Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------
How to play:

1. You will need to navigate the canvas by using the arrow    keys to help take your player from one side to the other.
2. The main task is to avoid getting hit by an enemy as you cross the canvas.
3. If you are hit by an enemy you will automatically start back in the beginning and start over.
4. Once you reach to the other side you will see a dialogue box which will say you win.

### Run the game locally
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Please visit my GitHub which can be accessed - https://github.com/kanagavarshini/Arcade-Game-Clone
2. The first step would be to download my game along with all of its files.
3. Once you have successfully saved the whole project in a designated location on you computer please go ahead and click on the index.html file.
